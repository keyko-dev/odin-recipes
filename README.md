# odin-recipes
This is my first project from TOP.
The goal of this project is to build a simple website that displays a collection of recipes using only **HTML** (and later I may add some CSS).  

## Project Description
The website will have:
- A main index page with links to individual recipe pages
- Recipe pages that include ingredients and steps

This project helps me practice:
- Writing clean **HTML structure**
- Using **headings, lists, links, and images**
- Organizing files properly

## Skills Demonstrated
- Basic **HTML** knowledge
- Project organization and file structure
