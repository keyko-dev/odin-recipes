          <h2>Ingredients</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>4 ¼ cups milk</li>
            <li>5 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>⅓ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon citric acid powder</li>
            <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
            <li>⅔ cup butter, divided</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Beat together milk and eggs in a large bowl until combined.</li>
            <li>Beat in sugar and salt. Mix in baking soda and citric acid until incorporated.</li>
            <li>Blend in flour, a little at a time, until combined. Beat in oil. Pour in boiling water, stirring constantly, until batter is thin and watery. Let rest for about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Brush a small frying pan with 1 tablespoon melted butter over medium-high heat. Pick the pan up off the heat. Pour in a ladleful of batter while you rotate your wrist, tilting the pan, so batter forms a circle and coats the bottom. The blini should be very thin.</li>
            <li>Return the pan to the heat. Cook blini for 90 seconds. Carefully lift up edge of blini to see if it's fully cooked: edges will be golden and bottom surface should have brown spots.</li>
            <li>Flip blini over and cook for 1 minute more.</li>    
            <li>Transfer blini to a plate lined with a clean kitchen towel.</li>
            <li>Continue cooking remaining batter, adding 1 tablespoon butter to the pan for every 4 blinis. Stack blinis and cover with another kitchen towel to keep warm.</li>
            <li>Spread desired filling in the center of each blini.</li>
            <li>Fold 3 times to make a triangle shape or fold up all 4 sides, like a small burrito.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
