          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>Borscht is a sour soup that is traditionally made with meat stock and boiled vegetables. The Ukrainian version, which features beets, is perhaps the most well known type — but varieties of borscht can be found throughout Central and Eastern Europe and Northern Asia.</p>
